Competition of predicting house pricing when given 79 explanatory varibles describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. My task was to predict the final price of each home. In order to acheive that, I did the following:
* Cleaned and Prepared the data
** Handled outliers and ensure that no null values were present in the dataset
* Feature Selection and Engineering
** Used statistical methods (Spearman Correlation and Random Forest Feature Importance) to choose the best features and reduced
** As for Engineering Used Hot Encoding of the categorical features, Binning and Log transformations on numerical features
* Evaluation Regression Models 
**compared them previous features that were used prior to feature selection and engineering
